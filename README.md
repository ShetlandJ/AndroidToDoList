# Android app - Role Playing Game to-do list.

This was a project that I undertook as part of my development through CodeClan, Scotland's Digital Skills academy. I chose the project from an array of options as I am a fan of gameification, and immediately had the idea to create a to-do list that allows you to level up as you complete your tasks.

Here is the spec:

## To-Do List

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data.

### MVP
You are required to write an Android app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task.
Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.

### Project Extensions

* Allow the user to prioritise and/or categorise tasks
* Use the calendar to set due dates on tasks.
